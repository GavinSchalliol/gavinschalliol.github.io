      <h1>&rarr; $ whois GavinSchalliol</h1>
      <p><h4>I am many things occasionally: technologist, business analyist and consultant at <a href="https://thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>, writer, translator, avid cyclist, hacker, reader, stargazer, and amateur rabble-rouser (which I prefer to "activist", out of deference to those many activists who are trained and experienced and dedicate far more of their lives to their work than I).</h4></p>
      <p><h4>I speak and write English, German, and Arabic.</h4></p>
      <p><h4>I have experience in Agile methodologies, coaching, facilitation, and inception planning.</h4></p> 
      <p><h4>I am currently teaching myself how to speak computer, and I'm currently baby-talking in Shell script, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I've used tools and frameworks such as Jekyll and impress.js (on this site!), as well as Gulp.js.</h4></p>
